sentence=Library for PCA and TCA I2C GPIO Expanders
paragraph=An Arduino Library for various 4 and 8-bit I<sup>2</sup>C expanders. This library handles the initialization of the expander IC and supports standard pinMode, digitalRead, and digitalWrite functions. The following ICs are supported: <b>PCA9534/TCA9534, PCA9536/TCA9536, PCA9537/TCA9537, PCA9554/TCA9554, PCA9556/TCA9556, PCA9557/TCA9557</b> and may support others. Library supports using alternate Wire ports (ie, Wire1, etc) as well as alternate I2C addresses. Includes support for Interrupt Pin errata (PCA9554).
